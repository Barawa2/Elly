# Analyzing-and-formatting-PostgreSQL-sales-data
Datacamp Project
## Project Overview
The project is aimed at challenging and enhancing SQL skills in data cleaning. The aim is to identify top categories based on the highest profit margins and detecting missing values.Date fields have been written to orders table as TEXT and numeric fields like sales and profits have been written to the orDers table as Double Precision. PostgreSQL was the tool used in this project and provided an excellent opportunity to apply my skills in a practical setting and gain valuable experience in data cleaning and analysis. 

## Data Sources
The dataset is available on datacamp. A hypothetical super store that has four tables namely; Orders, Returned_orders, people and products.

The SQL skills used in this project: 
  - Using subqueries
  - Windows Functions 
  - Data partitioning
  - Casting data types
  - CTEs
  - Grouping data
  - Generate Rank
## Analysis 
The following insights were uncovered from the dataset:
#### 1. Top five products for each category based on highest total sales.
